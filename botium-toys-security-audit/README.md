# Botium Toys Security Audit

This project documents a simulated internal cybersecurity audit conducted for a fictional retail company, Botium Toys.  
The audit evaluates the organization’s current security controls, identifies risks, and assesses compliance with industry standards and regulations.

## Project Overview
Botium Toys manages employee devices, internal networks, customer data, and e-commerce systems.  
This audit was performed to assess the effectiveness of existing administrative, technical, and physical security controls and to identify gaps that could impact data confidentiality, integrity, availability, and regulatory compliance.

## Audit Objectives
- Assess existing security controls across the organization
- Identify risks related to asset management and data protection
- Evaluate compliance with industry regulations and standards
- Document audit findings and provide security recommendations

## Scope
The audit covers:
- Employee and on-premises equipment
- Internal networks and internet access
- Business systems (e-commerce, accounting, databases, inventory)
- Data storage and retention practices
- Legacy systems
- Physical security controls at offices, storefront, and warehouse locations

## Frameworks and Standards Referenced
- NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF)
- Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)
- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)
- System and Organization Controls (SOC 1 & SOC 2)

## Project Contents
- **Control Categories** – Overview of administrative, technical, and physical controls
- **Risk Assessment** – Scope, assets, risk description, and risk score
- **Controls and Compliance Checklist** – Evaluation of implemented controls and compliance practices
- **Audit Findings and Recommendations** – Identified gaps and suggested improvements

## Key Takeaways
- Several critical security controls are missing or weak, particularly around access control, encryption, and business continuity.
- The organization faces a high overall risk due to limited monitoring, lack of backups, and insufficient data protection mechanisms.
- Implementing least privilege, encryption, intrusion detection, and disaster recovery planning would significantly improve the security posture.
