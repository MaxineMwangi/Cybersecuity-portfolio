# Botium Toys: Control Categories

## Overview

Controls within cybersecurity are grouped into three main categories:

1. **Administrative/Managerial Controls**  
2. **Technical Controls**  
3. **Physical/Operational Controls**  

These controls work together to provide **defense in depth** and protect organizational assets.

## Control Categories Explained

### Administrative/Managerial Controls
Administrative controls address the **human component** of cybersecurity.  
They include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and outline employee responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization.  

> Note: While administrative controls are typically policy-based, enforcing them may require the use of **technical** or **physical** controls.

Examples include:
- Security policies
- Employee training programs
- Account management policies

---

### Technical Controls
Technical controls consist of **solutions and tools** that help meet organizational security objectives.  
Examples include:
- Firewalls
- Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)
- Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS)
- Antivirus (AV) software
- Encryption

Technical controls can prevent, detect, or mitigate security incidents.

### Physical/Operational Controls
Physical/Operational controls **limit physical access** to assets by unauthorized personnel.  
Examples include:
- Door locks
- Cabinet locks
- Surveillance cameras
- Badge readers

## Control Types

Control types include:

1. **Preventative:** Designed to prevent an incident from occurring  
2. **Corrective:** Used to restore an asset after an incident  
3. **Detective:** Implemented to determine whether an incident has occurred or is in progress  
4. **Deterrent:** Designed to discourage attacks

## Administrative/Managerial Controls

| Control Name               | Control Type | Purpose |
|-----------------------------|-------------|---------|
| Least Privilege             | Preventative | Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts |
| Disaster Recovery Plans     | Corrective   | Provide business continuity |
| Password Policies           | Preventative | Reduce likelihood of account compromise through brute force or dictionary attacks |
| Access Control Policies     | Preventative | Bolster confidentiality and integrity by defining which groups can access or modify data |
| Account Management Policies | Preventative | Manage account lifecycle, reduce attack surface, limit impact from disgruntled former employees and default account usage |
| Separation of Duties        | Preventative | Reduce risk and overall impact of malicious insider or compromised accounts |

## Technical Controls

| Control Name                  | Control Type           | Purpose |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| Firewall                       | Preventative          | Filter unwanted or malicious traffic entering the network |
| IDS/IPS                        | Detective             | Detect and prevent anomalous traffic matching signatures or rules |
| Encryption                     | Deterrent             | Provide confidentiality to sensitive information |
| Backups                        | Corrective            | Restore/recover from an event |
| Password Management            | Preventative          | Reduce password fatigue |
| Antivirus (AV) Software        | Preventative          | Detect and quarantine known threats |
| Manual Monitoring & Maintenance| Preventative          | Identify and manage threats, risks, or vulnerabilities in outdated systems |

## Physical/Operational Controls

| Control Name                          | Control Type           | Purpose |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------|---------|
| Time-Controlled Safe                  | Deterrent             | Reduce attack surface and impact from physical threats |
| Adequate Lighting                     | Deterrent             | Deter threats by limiting hiding places |
| Closed-Circuit Television (CCTV)     | Preventative/Detective| Prevent certain events and review incidents after they occur |
| Locking Cabinets (for network gear)  | Preventative          | Prevent unauthorized physical access to network infrastructure |
| Signage Indicating Alarm Service     | Deterrent             | Deter threats by making attacks less likely |
| Locks                                 | Deterrent/Preventative| Deter and prevent unauthorized physical access |
| Fire Detection & Prevention           | Detective/Preventative| Detect fires and prevent damage to physical assets (inventory, servers, etc.) |
